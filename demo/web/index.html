        <h1>Request Worker Sample App</h1>
        <p>
        This sample app illustrates a typical Web application scenario with asynchronous request processing happening in the background, all running locally inside LocalStack.
        </p><p>
          The end-to-end process is illustrated in the figure on the right.
        </p><p>
          Here's how the app works:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use the button above to send a new request to local API Gateway, which will then be handled by a Lambda function for further processing. Enable "Auto-Refresh" to poll the status of the request.
          </li><li>
            As the request is going through different stages of processing, the table will be updated with the current request status (QUEUED -> PROCESSING -> FINISHED).
          </li><li>
            Once the request is FINISHED, the processing result will become available as a link to a file stored in S3.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          (Note that all resources will be deployed to the local "us-east-1" region.)
        </p><p>
